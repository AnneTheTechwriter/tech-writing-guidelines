# Accessibility

This resource is intended to help creators develop accessible products and content, however it is far from the only guideline. When in doubt, refer to the standards set by [W3C](http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility).

Content should be usable for the widest possible audience. This does not mean that everyone will understand every topic. However, writing with accessibility standards does not mean just making content easy to understand. It also means considering the organization of content to guide readers (be it visually or via screen readers, keyboard navigation, or a Braille interface).

There are a number of [additional resources](#additional-resources) from which this guide was sourced.

As you write, consider the following:

+ Can you quickly scan this document to understand what information is being presented?
+ If a user cannot see the colors, images, or videos, is the message still clear?
+ Is the markup clean?
+ Does this work well on devices with accessibility features?

## ARIA and alternative text guidelines

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a specification for creating content and applications which are accessible to people with disabilities.

### What is ARIA

Refer to the [W3C rules for ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/).

### When to use ARIA tags

### When to use alt tags

It's essential to use alternative text with photos. Those who are visually impaired and rely on screen readers will need the alt attributes to understand what is in an on-page image.

A bad example of alt text is: "this is a screenshot of our website".

## Guidelines for using images

## Guidelines for using videos

Like images, all content should be understood without videos. Videos should be used to enhance knowledge, rather than replace written content.

### Captions and transcripts

How to caption and add transcripts

## Content structure creates communication

Use heading levels to communicate the hierarchy of content. Emphasize important points both visually and stylistically. Use lists and tables to demonstrate a relationship between concepts. Provide summaries for tables and use informative, concise column headings.

Directional terms such as left, right, up, down, above, and below are not useful for those who use screen-readers. If you must use directional terms, provide additional information about the location such as "title bar" or "dialog box."
