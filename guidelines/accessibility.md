# Accessibility

This resource is intended to help creators develop accessible products and content, however it is far from the only guideline. When in doubt, refer to the standards set by [W3C](http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility).

Content should be usable for the widest possible audience. This does not mean that everyone will understand every topic. However, writing with accessibility standards does not mean just making content easy to understand. It also means considering the organization of content to guide readers (be it visually or via screen readers, keyboard navigation, or a Braille interface).

There are a number of [additional resources](#additional-resources) from which this guide was sourced.

As you write, consider the following:

+ Can you quickly scan this document to understand what information is being presented?
+ If a user cannot see the colors, images, or videos, is the message still clear?
+ Is the markup clean?
+ Does this work well on devices with accessibility features?

### Content structure creates communication

Use heading levels to communicate the hierarchy of content. Emphasize important points both visually and stylistically. Use lists and tables to demonstrate a relationship between concepts. Provide summaries for tables and use informative, concise column headings.

Directional terms such as left, right, up, down, above, and below are not useful for those who use screen-readers. If you must use directional terms, provide additional information about the location such as "title bar" or "dialog box."
